This repo contains some snippets regarding OpenSSL

* generate_priv_key: snippet which generates a private/public EC key pair using openssl
* read_random: tries to read x amount of bytes from a random source (eg /dev/urandom)

In order to build locally:

make generate_priv_key

In order to build for buildroot:

In order to build for buildroot, do the following:
 * add the following line to <build_dir>/sources/baseunit_build/baseunit_br_external/Config.in:
    source "$BR2_EXTERNAL/package/baseunit_package/opensslsnippets/Config.in"
 * add the directory 'opensslsnippets' to <build_dir>/sources/baseunit_build/baseunit_br_external/package/baseunit_package
 * add the following files to that directory: Config.in, opensslsnippets.mk
 * check in opensslsnippets.mk if the source directory is still correct

 * in <build_dir>/sources/baseunit_build
   ** execute 'make opensslsnippets'
   OR
   ** add opensslsnippets to the buildroot config
    *** make menuconfig
    *** select opensslsnippets (search for it :-))
    *** make savedefconfig
    *** make

note: in case you want to have a non-stripped version of the binaries on target, you
      need to add the binary name ('generate_priv_key.o') to the buildroot list of
      binaries which should not be stripped (make menuconfig --> Build options -->
      executables that should not be stripped --> add generate_priv_key.o)

note: in case of building for button, replace 'baseunit' by 'button' where applicable!
